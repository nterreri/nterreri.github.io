# Cookie Policy

This websites makes use of [Google Analytics][1] to collect information about visitors.

## TLDR:
**This information is primarily used to track overall number of visitors and number of visitors per blog post. None of it is shared with advertisers.**

**To opt out of tracking click [here](/privacy/optout)** but I won't know you visited :(

This site also automatically honors "do not track" requests.

### In more detail:
Additional information such as devices used, OS and browser information and geographic region is also tracked. No personally identifiable information is recorded or stored. Cookies are stored on your browser to keep track of different visitors and throttle hits.

No marketing, re-marketing or advertising features from the Google Analytics platform are used, so none of the information is shared with third parties, and none of it is not made available to advertisers.

To turn off Google Analytics tracking completely for your browser (on this and all other websites that use it), check out [their opt-out browser plugin][2]. Alternatively, you may also choose to delete or turn off cookies or disable JavaScript.
